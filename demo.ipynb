Contact the World Space Foundation.

WSF also provides partial funding for the\\n    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth\\n    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics\\n    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter.

I think Robert\\nStaehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.\\n\\nAlso there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,\\na technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),\\nand I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something\\nto say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as\\nquite a few references.\\n\\n\\nCheck the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary\\nSociety*:\\n\\nV36 p. 201-209 (1983)\\nV36 p. 483-489 (1983)\\nV37 p. 135-141 (1984)\\nV37 p. 491-494 (1984)\\nV38 p. 113-119 (1984)\\nV38 p. 133-136 (1984)\\n\\n(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of\\nreprints?
